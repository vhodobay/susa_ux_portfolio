      text1: "After my daughter was born, I chose to become a professional chef leaving a communications leader role behind. So far it may sound like an ordinary story of a mom changing careers because of kids, but perhaps my journey is a bit more adventurous.",
      text2: "Up until my daughterâ€™s first birthday I cooked in twenty two yoga camps with only a baby carrier and my brains with me, then I ran an apartment restaurant while working as a private chef for two families as well as an American actor, after which I worked as the chef of a Budapest based bistro. My favourite hashtag and personal philosophy is #foodislove. I love finding out how to make the most out of the most simple ingredients or show the world that you can create fantastic desserts out of cauliflower.",
      text3: "When my daughter turned nearly five, I felt it was time to look around over the border, so we settled down in Berlin to start over. I cooked at dinners of smaller and larger scale. I loved them all and yet I felt something was missing. Here continued my journey to find my path. I started my own little sustainable catering project Daily Love Food, and slowly started my doula carrier too. And now I'm learning to be a equity lover UX Designer to make the user experience of life more enjoyable"
